**Curriculum Module**

_Created with R2024b. Compatible with R2024b and later releases._

# Information

This curriculum module contains interactive [MATLAB® live scripts](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/live-editor.html), [Simulink®](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink.html), and [Simscape™](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simscape.html) models that provide a means to solving multi\-disciplinary engineering problems through systems thinking. The focus will be on problem solving for engineered systems that are applicable from introductory engineering to capstone/senior design.


## Background

This initial release of the Engineering Problem Solving courseware features one interactive script that explores problem solving philosophy with emphasis on engineering and concepts that involve systems engineering.

The instructions inside the live scripts will guide you through the exercises and activities. Get started with each live script by running it one section at a time. To stop running the script or a section midway (for example, when an animation is in progress), use the <img src="Images/EndIcon.png" width="19" alt="EndIcon.png"> Stop button in the **RUN** section of the **Live Editor** tab in the MATLAB Toolstrip.

## Contact Us

Solutions are available upon instructor request. Contact the [MathWorks teaching resources team](mailto:onlineteaching@mathworks.com) if you would like to request solutions, provide feedback, or if you have a question.


## Prerequisites

This module assumes knowledge of some problem solving theory and calculus. There is minimal MATLAB knowledge required for these scripts and models, but you could use [MATLAB Onramp](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/details/matlab-onramp/gettingstarted), [Simulink Onramp](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/details/simulink-onramp/simulink), and [Simscape Onramp](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/details/simscape-onramp/simscape) as resources to acquire familiarity with MATLAB syntax, live scripts, and Simulink/Simscape models.


## Getting Started
### Accessing the Module
### **On MATLAB Online:**

Use the [<img src="Images/OpenInMO.png" width="136" alt="OpenInMO.png">](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=MathWorks-Teaching-Resources/Engineering-Problem-Solving&project=EngineeringProblemSolving.prj) link to download the module. You will be prompted to log in or create a MathWorks account. The project will be loaded, and you will see an app with several navigation options to get you started.

### **On Desktop:**

Download or clone this repository. Open MATLAB, navigate to the folder containing these scripts and double\-click on [EngineeringProblemSolving.prj](https://github.com/MathWorks-Teaching-Resources/Engineering-Problem-Solving/blob/main/EngineeringProblemSolving.prj). It will add the appropriate files to your MATLAB path and open an app that asks you where you would like to start. 


Ensure you have all the required products (listed below) installed. If you need to include a product, add it using the Add\-On Explorer. To install an add\-on, go to the **Home** tab and select  <img src="Images/AddOnsIcon.png" width="16" alt="AddOnsIcon.png"> **Add-Ons** > **Get Add-Ons**. 


## Products

 *MATLAB®* is used throughout. Tools from  *Simulink® and Simscape™* are used frequently as well.  *If your module uses a product not on this list, you can find it* [*here*](https://www.mathworks.com/products.html)*.*


# Scripts

 *If you are viewing this in a version of MATLAB prior to R2023b, you can view the learning outcomes for each script* [*here*](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/180430-engineering-problem-solving)
